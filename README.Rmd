`{delphidocs}` provides a custom pkgdown template for Delphi packages. 
Please donâ€™t use it for your own package, but feel free to modify it for
your own purposes.

Inspired by [rotemplate](https://github.com/ropensci-org/rotemplate).

## Installation

You probably shouldn't install this package. It's just a template.


## Using the template

To use the `{delphidocs}` template for your pkgdown site, 
add the following to your `_pkgdown.yml` file:

``` yaml
---
template:
  package: delphidocs
---
```

You will also need to add the following to your `DESCRIPTION` file:

``` yaml
---
Config/Needs/website: cmu-delphi/delphidocs
---
```
